# MH Wilds CLI Armor Searcher
A simple Python project that reads a .csv file containing all armor sets from Monster Hunter Wilds, accepts a valid armor skill as input, and returns all known armor pieces containing that armor skill.\
Note that this project is currently a work-in-progress.\
The CSV file in the repo only contains sample armor data for the time being.
# Latest Changes
